A scalable decentralized financial bank account

This project has three distinct parts:

### Part 1: 
Use Solidity to design a smart contract that has similar functionality to an interest bearing savings account.

### Part 2: 
Within the contract, create deposit and withdraw functions for multiple accounts. Also, inject the contract address with pre-funded Ether which will act as the treasury of the bank, so there is liquidity available for withdrawal by any of its customers upon their wish to do so.

### Part 3: 
Create an interest bearing function that is tied to a block timestamp (per 100 days) for accruing interest for any of its customers that deposit into the contracts address.

### Technologies Used:
This project was built with the Solidity programming language within the IDE - REMIX for testing purposes.

### Remarks
Has basic but robust functionality, therefore is extensible. Please see the slides attached.
